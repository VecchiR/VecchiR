## 👤 About Me

I graduated with a bachelor’s in Electrical Engineering, but two years ago I took the leap into software development. I started with **The Odin Project**, learning the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and then diving into **React** on the frontend and **Node.js (and Express)** on the backend. I’ve also collaborated in the [Chingu community](https://www.chingu.io/) on a peer‑learning project.

I’m currently on the lookout for my first professional role as a developer!
